    "1. System \u2014 A unified computer-implemented system combining (i) 3D parametric avatar fitting; (ii) fabric-aware comparator with physics-based fit scoring; (iii) emotion- and trend-driven ranking; (iv) creative auto\u2011production (CAP) that emits production\u2011ready assets when catalog items fail thresholds; (v) dual\u2011biometric transaction approval (iris + voice with liveness); and (vi) JIT factory orchestration with secure status callbacks.",
    "2. Avatar \u2014 The avatar is generated from single/multi\u2011image capture using anthropometric priors and calibrated to user measurements; real-time cloth simulation renders drape and contact.",
    "3. Fit Score \u2014 The fit score f combines normalized silhouette deviation, predicted strain/relaxation per textile elasticity, and contact/penetration penalties, indexed per garment class and tolerance.",
    "4. Textile Index \u2014 Garment catalogs are indexed by pattern, tolerance, elasticity and style metadata; the comparator retrieves top\u2011k per class with tunable thresholds.",
    "5. CAP \u2014 Upon no garment meeting threshold, CAP generates a new garment design with parametric pattern files, seam allowances and color\u2011managed print assets, embedding metadata for traceability.",
    "6. ABVET \u2014 Payment approval requires dual-biometric authentication with voiceprint and iris scan including liveness checks; fused risk score gates transaction tokens.",
    "7. Orchestration \u2014 The JIT engine transmits production assets to certified factories via a secure interface, enforces latency SLAs and captures status events: queued, cutting, sewing, QA, shipped.",
    "8. Telemetry & Adaptation \u2014 The system logs fit outcomes, returns and user interactions, adapting models over time and updating recommendations; APIs are embeddable and version\u2011tracked (Git) across partner platforms."
